# IOT-HCI-project
Smart Book Shelf done as part of IOT-HCI project

We did an AR based immersive application  for browsing books in library using RFID system and marked Augmented reality technology under the guidance of Professor.
Ram Mohana Reddy Guddeti (https://in.linkedin.com/in/rammohana-reddy-guddeti-227a3323), and Lecturer Ms. Tanmayi.

Outcomes:
- Built a application that uses Augmented Reality and RFID
which shows the user the items present around him in a bookshelf.
- Giving more details about the particular item chosen by
clicking onto that AR image of item, the user can see details which cannot be found on the physical space.
